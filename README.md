<div style="display:flex">
    <img src="/Screenshots/iPhone_Launch.png" style="width: 18%">
    <img src="/Screenshots/iPhone_Home.png" style="width: 18%">
    <img src="/Screenshots/iPhone_Tasks.png" style="width: 18%">
    <img src="/Screenshots/iPhone_Search.png" style="width: 18%">
    <img src="/Screenshots/iPhone_Analytics.png" style="width: 18%">
</div>

By using the mobile application above, a user can keep track of his/her todo lists i.e. categories and tasks as well as see his/her completion analytics i.e. how many tasks are marked as active or done for each category.

Here are some areas for improvement:
1. Analytics Screen: Can add a Navigation View for additional charts such as number of active and done tasks over time for a category.
2. Tasks Screen: Can add a sort button or dropdown to allow the user to automatically order by category or task name; perhaps, also implement a manual ordering preference.
